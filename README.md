# Telepathy
Study of interaction and communication between brain and computer

## Disclaimer: 
## I have no knowledge in medicine, so please, tell me if you find something wrong. Try to not clone this project, is better if you join as a team member. We aren't obligated to do anything, because it is a volunteer project.

I started this project to without any objective to fill. 
My intention is only to document and to realise some computer experiments, that could improve my knowledge about "how the brain works?" and "what computers can do to solve brain problems?"

Step that I need to follow:

- Evaluation of the "state of the art" 
- Description about how brain/memories can be preserved, in terms of natural processes.
- Description of how some medications can affect the brain (positive and negative)
- How multimedia can help?
- How can we distinguish diseases from the brain (I will need volunteer help to achieve this)
- How to preserve/improve the brain processes, by non-invasive means and with the introduction of information technologies
- Development of Telepathy environment (Can use many tools and diferent programming languages, but each must fill the requirements of the project)
- - Java/Python/Lisp/Etc...
- - PostgreSQL/Postgis
- - QGIS
- - NLP
- - Multimedia
